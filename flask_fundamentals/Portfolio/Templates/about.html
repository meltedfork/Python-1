<p>I am Josh Moonstone. I was but a mere paper delivery boy until I was
    struck my a wizard-enchanted mars-meteorite. Now I am able to control
     and manipulate the gravity around me up to a radius of 30 feet. That
     means I can fly, bro. And make things float around me. Or make things
     stick to the ground. And I do it all with my mind.
